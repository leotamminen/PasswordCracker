# Brute Force Password Cracker

This is a simple Python script that performs a brute force attack to crack a password using a random character selection method. This script utilizes the `pyautogui` library for password input and leverages a straightforward algorithm to generate and test different password combinations.

## How It Works

1. The user is prompted to input the target password (`oikea_koodi`).
2. The script then generates random password combinations until the correct password is found.
3. The time taken to crack the password is recorded and displayed upon successful identification.

## Usage

1. Install the necessary library:
   ```bash
   pip install pyautogui
   ```

2. Run the Python script (`SalasananMurtaja.py`).

3. Enter the correct password when prompted.

4. The script will start the brute force attack and display each attempted password until the correct one is found.

## Warning

This script is intended for educational purposes only. Unauthorized use for malicious activities is strictly prohibited. Using brute force attacks to gain unauthorized access to accounts or systems is illegal and unethical.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pyautogui library

## Running the Script

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required library using the provided command.
3. Download the Python file (`SalasananMurtaja.py`).
4. Run the Python script and follow the on-screen instructions.

**Note:** The effectiveness of this script depends on the complexity and length of the target password. It may not be suitable for strong and secure passwords. Use it responsibly and only on systems for which you have explicit permission to test security.
